# Exercise 12.1-2

## Question:

What is the difference between the binary-search-tree property and the min-heap property (see page 129)? Can the min-heap property be used to print out the keys of an n-node tree in
sorted order in O(n) time? Explain how or why not.


## Answer:

It is impossible. Because the lower bound based on comparision is O(N*logN). Although it takes O(n) to build a heap. But each time we take the top, we have to adjust the heap whcih takes O(lgn) time.
