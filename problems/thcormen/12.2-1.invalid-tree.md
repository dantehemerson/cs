# Exercises 12.2-1
Suppose that we have numbers between 1 and 1000 in a binary search tree and want to search for the number 363. Which of the following sequences could not be the sequence of nodes examined?


a) 2, 252, 401, 398, 330, 344, 397, 363.

b) 924, 220, 911, 244, 898, 258, 362, 363.

c) 925, 202, 911, 240, 912, 245, 363.

d) 2, 399, 387, 219, 266, 382, 381, 278, 363.

f) 935, 278, 347, 621, 299, 392, 358, 363.


## Answer

As you can see in the next image, trees `c` and `d` are invalid, which makes the tree invalid and by consecuense those are not a valid sequence.
