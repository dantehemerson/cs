# Exercises 12.2-4

Professor Bunyan thinks he has discovered a remarkable property of binary search trees. Suppose that the search for key k in a binary search tree ends up in a leaf. Consider three sets: A, the keys to the left of the search path; B, the keys on the search path; and C, the keys to the right of the search path. Professor Bunyan claimsthatanythreekeysa2A,b2B,andc2C mustsatisfyabc.Give a smallest possible counterexample to the professorâ€™s claim.

## Answer

In the next tree, `A` is red(ðŸ”´), `B` is green (ðŸŸ¢) and `C` is blue (ðŸ”µ).

But `20(A)` is not `<=` `10(B)` so the claim `a <= b <= c` is false.
